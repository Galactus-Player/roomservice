[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/galactus-player/roomservice)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/galactus-player/roomservice)

The roomservice microservice is used in the galactus video player to create random codes which users will join.
This microservice creates random room codes, for example `1234`, and that code will be shared with other users when they would like to join the same room.
